Most software engineers use a tool called Git to organise their code, and collaborate with other people.

Git is a version control tool, used to keep the history of changes, and make collaboration easier. We'll see many of its uses throughout the course.

Each week, you're going to use Git to get a copy of your Coursework exercises, to submit your solutions, and to get feedback on your solutions. Today, you're going to learn how to do these things.
