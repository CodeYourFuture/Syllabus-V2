## 7) (Optional) IronHack Labs Practice

If you want more practice with the basics of making React components and passing props,

You should completed exercises 1-7 of https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-react-training

Notes:

- Do NOT make a pull request although the repo readme says so. We don't want the staff at the other school getting your PRs!
- Skip or simplify "Iteration 3" if you have problems with the maths.  
   E.g. just pass a max number `<RandomNumber max={100} />` and multiply that by Math.random().  
   Or pass no props.
- In "Iteration 6" just pass the prop as normal: `<Rating rating={4.5} />`.
  - To do it as specified in the exercise would require you to use something new: "props.children".
