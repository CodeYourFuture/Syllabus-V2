## Demo (60 minutes)
*Led by Students, presented back to the class*


Integrate all of your work together and share your progress so far with the mentors.

Your presentation should last **no more than five minutes** and could include:

- Slides detailing what you've done this week
- UI/UX designs of your project
- A video of your project
- A live example of your project

You can use this [basic template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pQ7teLv6k4uDvpG8qVLs5YgzpD7jRbMUmyyszHsNPhc/edit#slide=id.g90bd724b34_0_0)

The most important aspect of this presentation is that you are **clear** and **concise**. We want to see that you can present yourselves well and communicate information effectively.

At the end of your presentation you will have to answers questions on your project from the rest of the class. This will last for **a maximum of five minutes**.

## Retrospective (30 minutes)
*Facilitated by TAs*

Retro's can help a team focus on what is important and what they can improve for the next week. To get started quickly you can use one of the [Miro templates](https://miro.com/templates/feedback/)

- 5 mins - Individually everybody notes down.
  - You should include:
    - All the things that went well
    - All the things that didn't go well
    - Anything you should
- 10 minutes - In your groups discuss the ideas raised and group them together
  - Don't talk about solutions yet!
  - Identify key problems
- 15 mins - talk about solutions and identify actions to tackle problems

## User research (30 minutes)
*Facilitated by Product Managers* 

If you're building an internal product - show what you’ve built and what you’re planning to build next to potential users (other students, mentors, etc.) and use any feedback they have to improve your plans.

If you're working with on external product this might be tricky to do immediately but you spend time discussing how you could find users to demo to and the best way to contact them.

## Sprint planning (60 minutes)
*Facilitated by Product Managers* 

Decide what you’re each going to be doing during the following week and where you want to be by the next class.

## Technical support (60 minutes)
*Facilitated by TAs* 
Mentors will be on hand to help you get unstuck from any blocking technical issues.
