## Learning Goals

During the Project you will work on your technical and communication skills. At the end of this module you'll learn the following:

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how the parts of an application relate` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `Git` in a team setting
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in an `agile setting`

## Objectives

The final projects form the final module of the full-stack web development course, comprising four weeks following the completion of the last teaching-based module (currently the database module). The objectives of this module are to:

- Bring together everything the students have learned so far (most projects involve a Node/Express backend with a database and a React frontend);
- Give an opportunity to demonstrate teamwork and a mix of interpersonal and technical skills that the students can talk about when applying for jobs; and Deliver something valuable for CYF or a partner organisation.
- Also: nice portfolio piece; practice agile stuff; practical experience of junior dev role.

# Project team

Ideally, the project team would consist of the following:

- Four CYF students;
- Three volunteer mentors, forming a [balanced team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Q4Q8rCVpU); and
- A product owner.

The mentor group would include:

- an engineer (responsible for unblocking technical/architectural issues, _not_ an extra developer);
- a designer (responsible for user research and UI/UX);
- and a product manager (responsible for prioritisation and alignment with the product owner’s goals).

This gives an opportunity to bring in volunteers from the broader tech community, and exposes the students to the roles they could be collaborating with in employment.

The product owner would either be a representative from the partner organisation or someone at CYF, depending on the project. It’s important that they are able to engage at least twice a week with the team, and have the authority to make decisions that let the team keep moving.

## Weekly plan

We’re going to run the final projects in weekly “sprints”, planning out what we’re going to do as teams and as individuals. Each week will therefore look something like:

- **Daily standup**: post a daily message in the team Slack channel to let the rest of the team know what you’re working on, what progress you’ve made (even, and perhaps _especially_, if it’s none so far) and share anything that’s blocking you. Set a time for this and stick to it. Afterwards, post a team summary in the main class channel.

- **Mid-week check-in**: you should have at least one Slack call with the whole team and a mentor during the week to sync on progress, escalate any blockers and make sure that you’re still heading in the right direction.
- **Classes**: we’ll continue to meet on class days where we will be spending time on:
  - **Demo**: integrate all of your work together and share your progress so far with the mentors.
  - **Retrospective**: what’s gone well this week? What’s gone badly? What are you going to do differently next week to make things better?
  - **User research**: show what you’ve built and what you’re planning to build next to potential users (other students, mentors, etc.) and use any feedback they have to improve your plans.
  - **Sprint planning**: decide what you’re each going to be doing during the following week and where you want to be by the next class.
  - **Technical support**: mentors will be on hand to help you get unstuck from any blocking technical issues.
